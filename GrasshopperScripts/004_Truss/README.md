Dependencies
============
[GeometryGym](https://geometrygym.wordpress.com/) is required to run the script correctly. GeometryGym is my favourite plug-in to deal with structural related problem. It is common to use it when you want to export your model in .IFC file or if you want to generate a structural model to run in other packages ( Sap2000, Gsa, Strand, Robot ect.)
