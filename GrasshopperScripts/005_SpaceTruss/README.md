Requirements
============
[LunchBox](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/lunchbox) is required to run the script correctly. It is a fantastic plug-in for exploring mathematical shapes, paneling, structures, and workflow.  They have also introduced new components for general machine learning implementations such as regression analysis, clustering, and networks.
In the example file, LunchBox has been used to generate a simple space truss.
